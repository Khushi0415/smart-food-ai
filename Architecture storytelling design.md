# Smart Food AI – System Design Architecture

---

## 1. Architectural Vision

Smart Food AI is built as a distributed intelligence ecosystem that connects agricultural production, storage infrastructure, logistics networks, and consumer demand using AI-driven predictive coordination.

The architecture is designed around one central philosophy:

Move food using intelligence before spoilage happens.
