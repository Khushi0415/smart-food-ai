# 🌾 Smart Food AI
### *Predictive Food Survival Intelligence for Bharat*
**AI for Bharat Hackathon | Prototype Phase**


**Smart Food AI** is a cloud-native platform designed to empower farmers and street vendors. By leveraging the **ANNAPURNA AI Engine**, we provide actionable insights to prevent spoilage and stabilize income in the Indian agricultural supply chain.

## 🧠 The Intelligence Core: ANNAPURNA AI Engine
ANNAPURNA AI is our central decision intelligence system. It transforms fragmented agricultural data into a unified predictive framework to ensure food security.

### 🧪 Spoilage Intelligence Module (SIM)
* **Function:** Predicts crop deterioration using biological decay curves and weather models.
* **UI Integration:** Powers the **shelf-life indicators** and storage advice in the AI Advisor.

### 📊 Demand Intelligence Module (DIM)
* **Function:** Analyzes seasonal spikes and Mandi transaction patterns to predict hyperlocal consumption.
* **UI Integration:** Curates the **Marketplace** feed to match vendor stock with buyer needs.

### 📈 Economic Optimization Module (EOM)
* **Function:** Maximizes profitability by identifying price surge windows and market priority.
* **UI Integration:** Drives the **Impact Dashboard** metrics to show farmers their saved revenue.
