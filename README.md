🌟 Smart Food AI
AI-Powered Hyperlocal Smart Food System to Reduce Post-Harvest Loss & Food Insecurity in India

Smart Food AI is a cloud-based intelligent platform that connects farmers, storage providers, processors, and buyers using predictive analytics and real-time data insights to reduce food waste and improve supply chain efficiency.

🚨 Problem Statement

India faces significant post-harvest losses due to inefficient storage, price fluctuations, and poor market connectivity, leading to economic loss for farmers and food insecurity for communities.

💡 Our Solution

Smart Food AI uses machine learning and cloud infrastructure to:

• Predict crop prices
• Recommend optimal storage solutions
• Detect spoilage risk
• Connect farmers to buyers and processors
• Enable hyperlocal food redistribution

🌍 Why This Matters Now

India loses a major portion of perishable produce every year due to supply chain gaps. With rising population and climate challenges, AI-driven food supply optimization is critical for sustainable food security.

⭐ Unique Value Proposition (USP)

✔ Hyperlocal storage and demand matching
✔ AI-based spoilage prediction
✔ Real-time farmer decision support
✔ Cloud-native scalable architecture
✔ Community-focused food redistribution

⚙️ Kiro Workflow Integration

Smart Food AI follows a modular AI workflow using Kiro-based architecture.

The system processes crop data through structured pipelines to generate intelligent storage, pricing, and distribution recommendations. The .kiro directory defines project workflows, AI models, and system configuration.

🧠 Core Features

• AI Price Prediction
• Spoilage Risk Detection
• Smart Storage Recommendation
• Hyperlocal Marketplace Integration
• Real-Time Alert Notifications
• Supply-Demand Forecasting

🏗 Architecture Overview

Smart Food AI follows a cloud-native serverless architecture:

User Application → API Gateway → AWS Lambda → AI Models → Storage & Analytics → Insight Delivery

📱 Smart Food AI – Wireframe Overview

The following wireframes illustrate the proposed user interface and workflow of the Smart Food AI platform. The design focuses on simplicity, rural accessibility, and real-time decision support.

🟢 Dashboard

Provides farmers with real-time insights including:

• Crop price trends
• Spoilage risk alerts
• Nearby storage availability
• Market demand insights

This screen acts as the central decision-support hub for users.

🟢 Produce Upload

Allows farmers to upload produce details such as:

• Crop type
• Quantity
• Product images

AI analyzes the uploaded data to predict shelf life and spoilage risk, helping farmers take preventive actions.

🟢 Storage Finder

Displays hyperlocal storage facilities with:

• Location mapping
• Storage cost comparison
• Availability status
• Distance from user

This enables farmers to quickly identify the best storage options.

🟢 Marketplace

Connects farmers directly with buyers and processors by showing:

• Real-time produce listings
• Market price comparison
• Nearby buyers
• Direct transaction opportunities

🟢 Alerts & Notifications

Provides AI-generated alerts including:

• Spoilage risk warnings
• Price fluctuation notifications
• Storage availability updates

This ensures proactive decision-making and reduces food wastage.
The wireframe design prioritizes intuitive navigation, low digital literacy accessibility, and real-time agricultural decision support.

# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
