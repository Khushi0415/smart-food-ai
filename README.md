🌾 Smart Food AI
AI-Powered Hyperlocal Smart Food System to Reduce Post-Harvest Loss & Food Insecurity in India

📌 Problem Statement
India experiences significant post-harvest food losses due to inefficient storage, poor demand forecasting, and lack of real-time market intelligence. Farmers often sell produce at low prices or lose crops due to spoilage, while many communities still face food insecurity.

💡 Solution Overview

Smart Food AI is a cloud-based AI platform that connects farmers, storage providers, food processors, and buyers through predictive analytics and hyperlocal distribution intelligence.

The system uses machine learning to predict price trends, spoilage risks, and demand patterns while recommending storage and redistribution strategies to minimize food loss and improve food accessibility.

🎯 Objectives

Reduce post-harvest food wastage

Improve farmer income stability

Enable hyperlocal food redistribution

Provide AI-based decision support

Strengthen sustainable food supply chains
